Blender.LectureEdit
===================

*Blender.LectureEdit* is a script library for the video creation software `Blender <https://www.blender.org/>`_, that facilitates the editing of lecture videos, in which feature a speaker, who is visible in front of their presentation slides.
It automates routine tasks in the editing of such videos, which saves time, makes the videos of a series of lectures more consistent and allows for corrections in the slide deck without major re-editing of the video or even re-recording of the lecture.

* `Facilitation of the synchronization of multiple camera tracks <https://blenderlectureedit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/steps/synchronization.html#synchronization>`_
* `Automated setup of the compositing for processing green screen recordings of the speaker <https://blenderlectureedit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/steps/greenscreen.html#greenscreen>`_
* `Exporting the slide transition times and starting times of animations to a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation <https://blenderlectureedit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional/slide_edits.html#slide-edits>`_
* `Normalization of the audio track's loudness <https://blenderlectureedit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/steps/audio.html#normalization>`_
* `Automation of blending out the speaker for certain slides <https://blenderlectureedit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/steps/merge.html#fadeout>`_

Credits
-------

*Blender.LectureEdit* has been created and is maintained in the scope of the `CYSTINET-Africa <https://www.cysti.net>`_ project.
This project is a coalition of five universities in Tanzania, Zambia, Mosambique and Munich to do research on medical and economic aspects of the *Taenia solium* tapeworm.
One goal of this project is to create an eLearning course about *Taenia solium* for students of veterinary and human medicine.
*Blender* and *Blender.LectureEdit* are used to edit the lecture videos for this course.

Maturity of the project
-----------------------

So far, *Blender.LectureEdit* is being used for the lecture videos in the `CYSTINET-Africa <https://www.cysti.net>`_ project.
There, it has proven useful for a large number of edited videos, even though it leads to occasional crashes of *Blender* or fails to process *PowerPoint* files with timed slide transitions.
