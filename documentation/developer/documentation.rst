Generating the documentation
============================

You can use the Makefile to generate a local set of html-files with the documentation for *Blender.LectureEdit*.
for this, run the command

.. code-block::

   make docs

If everything works, you will find the generated documentation in the ``docs`` directory.
Open the ``index.html`` file to view the start page.

*Blender.LectureEdit* uses `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to generate the documentation.
In addition to that, you need the `Read the Docs Sphinx Theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/>`_ installed.
